CodeShareFrontend is an application written in React that allows multiple users to write code together in real time. 

The application requires an API written in ASP.NET to function. The application allows users to register, log in and manage their account.

Users can create up to 10 code snippets in their free account. The app supports multi-language (i18n) and provides user-friendly notifications for actions like deleting snippets or changing a nickname.
